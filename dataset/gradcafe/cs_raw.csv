Until we can hire more HCI faculty (we lost one to Cornell this summer), we will be very cautious in admission.  We also lowered the target number of new graduate students this year, while applications were up by about 150 from last year.  This was partly due to faculty deaths, retirement, and departures, as well as two very large classes (both broke records) in 2012 and 2013.

Interestingly both the applications were exactly same in all aspects. So if you still await response, I suggest you ensure whether all your app material reached them in time.

GaTECH's a nice school but UT seems to be a better choice considering all the financial support UT has granted upon me. I'm still waiting on CMU(as they still haven't released their results;seems like I'm on the waitlist or something;) What do you think about CMU?
